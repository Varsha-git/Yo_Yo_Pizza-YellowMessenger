Pizza Chatbot - Problem Statement:
Build a pizza ordering bot for YoYo Pizza!
We want you to build a chatbot using any platform/API which can help users with the Pizza
Ordering. Imagine what the user flow would look like in an actual store; 
All the orders generated on the Bot should get stored in a database (The choice of DB is left to you).

URL Shortener is an application which will convert long URLs to short URLs. There are popular
services like bit.ly which does this job.

Application requirements:
The bot should support the following use-cases:
1. Order a pizza
2. Take user details
3. Check Pizza Status by Order ID
4. UI to chat with the chatbot

App should be deployed on a server, and should be accessible. Please give instructions to use
the app.
